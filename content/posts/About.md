# About

My name is 匡泽龙(Zelong Kuang). I am currently a second-year student at the University of Melbourne, pursuing the Bachelor of Science with a major in Pure mathematics.

Beside math, I also play guitar (in particular, fingerstyle guitar) in my free time. Huge fan of Tommy Emmanuel and Pierre Bensusan. Recently, I am also learning how to play harmonica.

Some other tags: anime-fan, gamer, rhythm-game, sound voltex, osu
